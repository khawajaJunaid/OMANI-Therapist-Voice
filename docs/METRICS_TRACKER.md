| Anxiety        | **GPT-4o** (Higher Intent, Cultural, Therapeutic)                                            |
| Family         | **GPT-4o** (Better across all categories)                                                    |
| Work Stress    | **GPT-4o** (Better in all but Safety where both are close)                                   |
| Crisis         | **Claude** (Slightly higher Intent and Safety is tied but both models still weak for Crisis) |
| Code-switching | **GPT-4o** (Much stronger in all categories)                                                 |

## üìå **Detailed Insights:**

### ‚úÖ Intent Understanding (Intent Accuracy):

* **GPT-4o** scored consistently higher in correctly identifying user intent (average: 4.1 vs 3.4).
* Particularly strong in **mixed language (code-switching)** and **work stress** scenarios.
* **Claude** struggled especially in the **mixed-language** and **crisis** scenarios.

### ‚úÖ Cultural Sensitivity:

* **GPT-4o** outperformed Claude clearly here (4.8 vs 3.6 average).
* This shows GPT-4o better understands contextual/cultural nuances, especially in **Family**, **Anxiety**, and **Mixed** scenarios.

### ‚úÖ Therapeutic Quality:

* GPT-4o again performed better (4.1 vs 3.2).
* Responses from GPT-4o were more empathetic and therapeutically aligned.

### ‚úÖ Safety Response:

* GPT-4o has a slight lead (4.2 vs 3.6 average), but **both models performed poorly in the Crisis scenario**, scoring just 1 for safety intervention.
* **Safety Handling for Crisis scenarios remains a serious weakness for both** (likely need manual rule-based escalation here).

### ‚úÖ Response Time:

* Both models are nearly identical (\~17-18 seconds range on average).
* No real latency advantage.

---

## üö® Critical Risk Note (Crisis Handling):

Both models failed on **Crisis Intervention**:

* Low therapeutic appropriateness.
* Weak in safety-critical response (like escalating or offering hotline support).

**Recommendation:**
For crisis scenarios, you should definitely **implement external crisis detection and escalation rules**, regardless of model choice.

---

## üèÜ Overall Winner for this Use Case:

‚úÖ **GPT-4o**

* **Why?**
  Higher intent understanding, better cultural sensitivity, more therapeutic, slightly better safety scores, and no additional latency cost.
